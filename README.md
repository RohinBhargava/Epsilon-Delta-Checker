# Epsilon-Delta-Checker

This Epsilon Delta Checker iteratively finds a solution to the famous delta-epsilon proof for a given epsilon, function, and point at which to evaluate a delta. The precision has been experimentally chosen to be 10^-8 because of time concerns on one hand and accuracy concerns on the other. Functionality does not include logistic/e functions or trigonometry quite yet. I will be working on updating this in the near future.
